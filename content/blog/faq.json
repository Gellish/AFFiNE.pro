Not suitable for production, as it's lightly tested.\n\nStable: The most reliable, well-tested version for a smooth experience without crashes or glitches. Usually released 1-2 weeks after beta.\n\nCanary: Cutting-edge version with the latest features, released as soon as they're built, but untested.\n\n\n\nQ: How should I choose which version to use?\n\nA: We recommend that everyone who wants to explore and experience new features download the Canary version. If you want a more stable experience, please switch to the Stable version.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nQ: Does AFFiNE offer a mobile app?\n\nA: While acknowledging the importance of mobile applications, our current strategic emphasis is on desktop development to optimize resource utilization and enhance the user experience. Mobile app development remains a vital component of our long-term strategy, and it will be addressed in alignment with our broader goals and standards at a suitable time in the future.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nQ: Can I access AFFiNE through a web browser?\n\nA: Yes, you can access our web version at [https://app.affine.pro/](https://app.affine.pro/,) , but for a better experience, download our PC client. It offers stability, enhanced performance, and exclusive features for the best platform experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Create and Edit**\n\nQ: How to switch between Page and Edgeless pages?\n\nA: By clicking the buttons located at the top of the interface, you can seamlessly transition between various features. This allows you to fully experience the robust capabilities encompassing writing, drawing, and panning all in one.\n\n\n![VIC5DZB4PWzxoY6Zsvgpl3CJdiPEbOFC7Hoa2PP9XVg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/VIC5DZB4PWzxoY6Zsvgpl3CJdiPEbOFC7Hoa2PP9XVg=)\n\n\n\nQ: How to establish a hierarchical note structure?\n\nA: We are presently without a hierarchical note structure but acknowledge its value for collaboration. Our team is diligently improving document and whiteboard integration, both in the design phase. These enhancements are expected to launch by year-end.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nQ: Is there an option for toggle/outline lists?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the requested feature is not available at present. We appreciate its importance, but it is not yet available in the stable version.

You can click \"All pages\" and find the \"filter\" button on the upper left to filter your articles according to tags, collections or other rules.\n\n  \n![Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=)\n\n  \n![Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=)\n\n\n\n# **Share and Collaborate**\n\nQ: I have invited my collaborator, but why can't users join my cloud workspace?\n\nA: The collaboration feature is currently being improved and will be available for multiple users on AFFiNE Cloud by November. For immediate collaboration needs, please contact us at [https://community.affine.pro/home](https://community.affine.pro/home), and we will manually grant access to your partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Sync and Backup**\n\nQ: When can users anticipate the availability of the free version of AFFiNE Cloud?\n\nA: We are pleased to announce that the Professional edition of AFFiNE Cloud Services will be launching in November. Additionally, our free version of cloud services will also be introduced. If you wish to experience AFFiNE Cloud's services in advance, we cordially invite you to participate in our exclusive \"Early Access Believer Program.\" You can find more information here: [https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access](https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access). If you would like to become an Early Access Believer, you can sponsor us through this channel: [https://community.affine.pro/c/insider-general/](https://community.affine.pro/c/insider-general/). If you have already purchased AFFiNE Cloud, please download version 0.9.0 Beta.\n\n\n\nQ: How to access AFFiNE cloud?\n\nA:\n\n1. **Log in to Your Email**: After becoming a sponsor, you will receive an email from the AFFiNE team confirming that your email address has been added to the whitelist. You can log in to AFFiNE with this email. Additionally, you have the option to sign in using your Google account.\n1. **Create Your Cloud Workspace**: You can create a local workspace and then enable it to a cloud workspace.\n  \n![VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=)\n\n  \n![VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=)\n\n1. **Invite your collaborators**: You can add user emails to the workspace and invite collaborators to work together.\n  \n![RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=)\n\n  \n![RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=)\n\n**Detailed Guidelines**: For more detailed instructions or information about the new features or changes in the service, you can refer to the provided link: [https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922](https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922)\n\n  \n\n  \n\nQ: Isn't the Docker image meant for self-hosting? Why is that dependent on the cloud?\n\nA: The Docker image is primarily designed for self-hosting, enabling users to run it on their own servers. Nevertheless, it is built to provide flexibility. Users have the option to configure it to integrate with cloud services if they find it necessary, depending on their specific needs. Regardless of whether you choose to utilize cloud services or host locally, deploying the architecture remains an essential step.\n\n\n\nQ: Is the underlying collaboration technology shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions?\n\nA: Yes, the underlying collaboration technology is shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions. This ensures consistency in features and functionality across different deployment options. Please note that while local peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration features may not have been developed yet, the core collaboration technology remains consistent across all deployment methods. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\nQ: Does AFFiNE provide support for end-to-end encryption?\n\nA: Certainly, AFFiNE extends robust support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Our platform prioritizes data security while fostering seamless teamwork within local networks. With AFFiNE, you can confidently leverage E2EE alongside local area network (LAN) collaboration. Moreover, our collaboration framework, based on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensures that real-time collaboration remains unhindered by geographical constraints, network speeds, and even offline usage. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Others**\n\nQ: Is it possible to build 3rd-party plugins now?\n\nA: The plugin system is in early development, accessible exclusively within the Canary version. We are actively progressing with this feature and anticipate its availability by year-end. First-party plugins will be developed initially, followed by integration of GitHub and Figma plugins, scheduled for launch in January 2024. We also plan to introduce a stable API interface in the coming year, enabling users to create third-party plugins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the information provided above does not address your question, please feel free to reach out to us on our community forum, Discord, or Telegram.
