Not suitable for production, as it's lightly tested.\n\nStable: The most reliable, well-tested version for a smooth experience without crashes or glitches. Usually released 1-2 weeks after beta.\n\nCanary: Cutting-edge version with the latest features, released as soon as they're built, but untested.\n\n\n\nQ: How should I choose which version to use?\n\nA: We recommend that everyone who wants to explore and experience new features download the Canary version. If you want a more stable experience, please switch to the Stable version.\n\n\n\nQ: Does AFFiNE offer a mobile app?\n\nA: While acknowledging the importance of mobile applications, our current strategic emphasis is on desktop development to optimize resource utilization and enhance the user experience. Mobile app development remains a vital component of our long-term strategy, and it will be addressed in alignment with our broader goals and standards at a suitable time in the future.\n\n\n\nQ: Can I access AFFiNE through a web browser?\n\nA: Yes, you can access our web version at [https://app.affine.pro/](https://app.affine.pro/,) , but for a better experience, download our PC client. It offers stability, enhanced performance, and exclusive features for the best platform experience.\n\n\n\n### **Create and Edit**\n\nQ: How to establish a hierarchical note structure?\n\nA: We are presently without a hierarchical note structure but acknowledge its value for collaboration. Our team is diligently improving document and whiteboard integration, both in the design phase. These enhancements are expected to launch by year-end.\n\n\n\nQ: Is there an option for toggle/outline lists?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the requested feature is not available at present. We appreciate its importance, but it is not yet available in the stable version. We request your patience as we work towards including it in future updates.\n\n\n\n### **Organize and Tags**\n\nQ: Does AFFiNE support filtering articles by tag?\n\nA: Yes. You can click \"All pages\" and find the \"filter\" button on the upper left to filter your articles according to tags, collections or other rules.\n\n  \n![Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/Iaa3Wvw95dI5n9fCFgMO7d-fSQPDHUbYpN2F3ks7jqg=)\n\n### **Share and Collaborate**\n\nQ: When can users anticipate the availability of the free version of AFFiNE Cloud?\n\nA: We are pleased to announce that the Professional edition of AFFiNE Cloud Services will be launching in November. Additionally, our free version of cloud services will also be introduced. If you wish to experience AFFiNE Cloud's services in advance, we cordially invite you to participate in our exclusive \"Early Access Believer Program.\" You can find more information here: [https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access](https://affine.pro/blog/affine-cloud-early-access). If you would like to become an Early Access Believer, you can sponsor us through this channel: [https://community.affine.pro/c/insider-general/](https://community.affine.pro/c/insider-general/). If you have already purchased AFFiNE Cloud, please download version 0.9.0 Beta.\n\n\n\nQ: How to access AFFiNE cloud?\n\n### 5) **Sync and Backup**\n\nSync with AFFiNE Cloud\n\nQ: Isn't the Docker image meant for self-hosting? Why is that dependent on the cloud?\n\nA: The Docker image is primarily intended for self-hosting on local servers, but it offers flexibility for users to integrate with cloud services if required, depending on their specific needs. Regardless of the choice between local hosting or cloud integration, deploying the architecture remains essential.\n\n\n\nQ: Is the underlying collaboration technology shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions?\n\nA: Yes, the underlying collaboration technology is shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions. This ensures consistency in features and functionality across different deployment options. Please note that while local peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration features may not have been developed yet, the core collaboration technology remains consistent across all deployment methods. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\nQ: Does AFFiNE provide support for end-to-end encryption?\n\nA: Certainly, AFFiNE offers robust end-to-end encryption (E2EE) support, prioritizing data security and local network teamwork. E2EE and LAN collaboration are seamlessly integrated. Real-time collaboration is facilitated using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), overcoming geographic and network limitations, even in offline scenarios. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n**Others**\n\nQ: Is it possible to build 3rd-party plugins nowï¼Ÿ\n\nIf the information provided above does not address your question, please feel free to reach out to us on our community forum, Discord, or Telegram.
